    If we simply do `conda env export > environment2.yml` we will obtain every
    library, not just the key ones we select for inclusion. This can make knowing
    the subset of key libraries difficult, and reduce chances of successful env
    replication.

    This util takes the current environment.yml (with current hashes
    and # commented libraries)* and an environment.yml which is generated
    by above command, and prints the minimal set of libraries needed.

    * While experimenting with new libraries, it can be useful to mark the new
    libraries as a comment in the file until ready to include.
