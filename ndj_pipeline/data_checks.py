"""Schemas and assertions for raw data inputs.
Schema checks are useful to standardize certain information in raw data including:

* Clean column names (lowercase, underscore)
* Ensure an understanding of primary keys of data (uniqueness)
* Set data types of columns, i.e. boolean->int, datetime, string, nullable integer
* Pandera schema checks to attempt to lock some checks about a datafile. This helps
  to quickly assess if a file has changed, or a similar file is same or different.
  Some examples:

  * Contains exact list of columns (no more no less)
  * Nullable column
  * Data type correct
  * Data range checks (must not be 0 or less, must contain only these values)

Schemas can often be re-applied to similar data files, i.e. tabs of an excel, or train/test data.
