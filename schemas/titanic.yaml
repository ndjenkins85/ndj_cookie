  The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous
  shipwrecks in history.

  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely
  considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding
  with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough
  lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death
  of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

  While there was some element of luck involved in surviving,
  it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
